# Explore Global Fishing Effort Data

This repository contains code and a shiny app for exploring and plotting the global fishing effort database created using methods described in Rousseau et al. 2023, Scientific Data. The full database is held here: https://doi.org/10.25959/MNGY-0Q43.

There are two parts to this repo:<br>

**1. Exploring country level data:**
The primary data compilation is by fishing country. 
To explore country level fishing effort data go to "Explore_fishing_capacity.Rmd"

**2. Methods for mapping country level data to 0.5 spatial grid cells:**
We have included example code for mapping the data, for 2016 and 2017. 
There are two parts: Mapping_effort_2017.R and Mapping_part2.R
